Never forget the score again. Download the Tennis Scorekeeper App!

You're up a set and leading 3-0 in the 2nd set... wait, are you really? "What's the score?", your opponent asks you. Has this ever happened to you? If so, you need to download the Tennis Scorekeeper App!

The Tennis Scorekeeper App helps users keep track of their match score in both 1 set and best of 3 set formats with optional 10 point tiebreak scoring for the final set. Simply press one of the two buttons on the Apple Watch app and you will be able to both visually see the match score as well as hear Siri call out the score after each point. 

In addition to being able to see the score on your Apple Watch, one of your adoring fans or your support team (parents, coach, etc.) can follow the score on your iPhone! Using the Watch Connectivity library, the iOS app updates in real-time to sync with what is seen on the Apple Watch.
